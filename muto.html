  <p>"MUTO" is an acronym for "Massive Unidentied Terrestrial
Organism". Director Gareth Edwards stated that "it's basically
the UFO of monsters". MUTOs are sexually dimorphic species.
The female is much larger and walks on eight limbs - the
male is much smaller, with one pair of his eight limbs modi-
ed into wings for powered ight. Though the MUTOs have
an arthropod-like appearance. The angularity of the male
MUTO's wing design was inspired by stealth aircraft As a
side-elect of the radiation they absorb as food, the MUTOs
are capable of causing electromagnetic interference, the
male emitting EMP shockwaves from his claws and the
female having an EMP eld "Sphere of Inuence" surrounding her instead.</p>

    <p> King Ghidorah is a ctional monster,
    which rst appeared in Ishir≈ç Honda's
    1964 lm Ghidorah, the Three-Headed
    Monster. Although the name of the
    character is ocially trademarked by
    Toho as "King Ghidorah", the character
    was originally referred to as Ghidorah or
    Ghidrah in some English markets.
    Although King Ghidorah's design has
    remained largely consistent throughout
    its appearances, its origin story has varied
    from being an extraterrestrial planet-killing dragon, a genetically engineered
    monster from the future, a guardian
    monster of ancient Japan, or a god from
    another dimension. The character is
    usually portrayed as an archenemy of
    Godzilla and a foe of Mothra, though it
    has had one appearance as an ally of the
    latter.</p>

  <p> Mothra was first conceived in January 1961 serial The Luminous Fairies and
    Mothra by authors Shinichiro Nakamura, Takehiko Fukunaga, and Yoshie Hotta, who
     had been commissioned by Toho to write the outline of a future film. The
     character was further developed by Shinichi Sekizawa. There are often two
     fairies around Mothra. Their singing can call Mothra to grow and communicate with Mothra.
     They are very important partners of Mothra. Mothra was originally flown from the island of Iba.
     It is a monster that protects the peace of earth. But sometimes because of the rapid flight, many
      houses and buildings are destroyed by him. Mothra's appearance changes through several stages of growth such as eggs,
       larvae, cocoons, and adults.</p>
